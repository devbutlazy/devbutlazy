`DevOps` `Backend` `Toolsmith` 

**Anything-You-Want Developer** with 6+ years of experience making stuff that actually works. 

I care about clean code, smart automation, and not having to fix the same bug twice. Big fan of clear structure, dumb-simple solutions, and working with people who arenâ€™t afraid to argue over better ideas.

Too lazy to write a long intro â€” good code speaks for itself anyway.
