`DevOps` `Backend` `Toolsmith` 

DevOps Engineer, Backend Developer, and Toolsmith from Ukraine with over five years of hands-on experience building reliable and purpose-driven software. Focused on automation, custom tooling, and backend systems that make workflows smoother and development faster.

Most of my work is in Python, JavaScript, and Go, but I also have solid experience with C and C++ when performance or low-level control is needed. I am especially interested in creating CLI & TUI tools that are both efficient and user-friendly. I work primarily on Windows and Linux, and Iâ€™m in common with UNIX system management and networking.

All in all, I enjoy making things that are useful, and I treat debugging as a chance to refine my code - not just fix it. Collaboration and feedback are always welcome.
