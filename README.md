**Anything-You-Want Developer** with 6+ years of experience making stuff that actually works. 

I care about clean code, smart automation, and not having to fix the same bug twice. Big fan of clear structure, dumb-simple solutions, and working with people who aren’t afraid to argue over better ideas.

Too lazy to write a long intro — good code speaks for itself anyway.
