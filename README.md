`DevOps` `Backend` `Toolsmith` 

**Anything-You-Want Developer** with 6+ years of experience building reliable and purpose-driven software. Specialization lies in Python, Go and C/C+.

Core values include clean architecture, automation, and maintainability, with a strong preference for collaborative environments where feedback and knowledge sharing drive continuous improvement.

Actually, I'm too lazy to come up with something more for my readme. Although, good developers don't need an introduction =)
