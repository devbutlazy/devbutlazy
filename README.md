`DevOps` `Backend` `Toolsmith` 

**Anything-You-Want Developer** with 6+ years of experience building reliable and purpose-driven software. Mainly work with Python, Go and C/C+. Kinda a fan of clean architecture, automation, and maintainability, with a strong preference for collaborative environments.

Actually, I'm too lazy to come up with something more for my readme. Although, good developers don't need an introduction =)
