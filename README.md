`DevOps` `Backend` `Toolsmith` 

Experienced engineer from Ukraine with 5+ years of proven expertise in building resilient, scalable, and purpose-driven software solutions. My work primarily focuses on backend systems, process automation, and the design of custom developer tooling that accelerates workflows and improves team productivity.

Specialization lies in Python and Go, complemented by a strong background in C/C++ for performance-critical or low-level applications. Professional experience spans Windows and UNIX systems, including system administration, networking, and environment optimization.

Particular focus is placed on developing TUI applications, websites, and Telegram bots that combine efficiency with intuitive usability. Debugging and optimization are approached as opportunities to enhance quality, reliability, and long-term maintainability, rather than simply means of resolving issues.

Core values include clean architecture, automation, and maintainability, with a strong preference for collaborative environments where feedback and knowledge sharing drive continuous improvement.
